lifestyles, thereby mitigating the risk factors associated with different causes of death and reducing
overall mortality rates. Furthermore, the insights derived from this analysis serve as valuable predictive
tools for future planning and intervention strategies, enabling proactive measures to anticipate and
prevent potential health challenges. In summary, leveraging these findings empowers stakeholders to
develop proactive interventions aimed at preventing causes of death and controlling diseases, ultimately
leading to the creation of healthier communities and improved public health outcomes.
